**Hello World Counters** is a simple and discreet tally counter app for Android and the Web (PWA), built as one of my first "Hello World" projects in Flutter.

[Hello World programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) are pretty famous, even if all they do is write "Hello, World!" on the screen. When learning a new programming language or platform, starting with such a simple program has become a tradition.

The app provides several distinct counters, each corresponding to a basic English color term (Red, Green, Blue, etc.). This design allows you to track multiple items simultaneously and discreetly — without anyone needing to know what you're counting.

### Features

- **Discreet, Color-Coded Counters:** Keep track of multiple tallies at once.
- **Simple Controls:** Easily increment, decrement, and reset each counter.
- **Share Functionality:** Share your counts via email, messengers, or social media.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of the app in action:

## Run or Install

* **On Android:** Get it from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/TheHelloWorldWriter/hello_world_counters/releases).
* **On any platform:** [Run the web app](https://helloworldcounters.thehelloworldwriter.com/) or install it directly from your browser on most modern operating systems, including Android, ChromeOS, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Contributing

Thank you for contributing! Hello World Counters is designed to be as simple and useless as possible, but you can still help with:

* testing and reporting bugs
* creating a nice icon to replace the [current one](web/icons/Icon-512.png)

## Legacy project

A legacy version of the app, named **Counters With Color Names**, is still available in the [`counters_with_color_names`](https://github.com/TheHelloWorldWriter/hello_world_counters/tree/counters_with_color_names) branch.

The actively maintained **Hello World Counters** app is in the [`main`](https://github.com/TheHelloWorldWriter/hello_world_counters/tree/main) branch.
